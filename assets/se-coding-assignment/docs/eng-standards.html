        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>
            At Chaldal, we strive to produce high quality engineering work. An ideal Chaldal engineer is one who has a strong sense of ownership towards their work. The entire code base is their code base, the product is their product. They proactively find ways to strengthen and improve the processes of the company, often questioning assumptions.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Our selection process is designed towards identifying engineers who share this vision. The way this is achieved is sometimes subtle, but we make it a point to share our evaluation criteria with candidates in the interest of transparency.
        </p>

        <h1>ENGINEERING SKILLS CRITERIA</h1>

        <p> All evaluations are based on the following criteria </p>


        <h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

        <p>
            When faced with a problem statement, you are able to read the problem, think into the consequences and implications of what’s written, analyze what is missing or is left unsaid. You are able to follow written instructions precisely, proactively ask for clarifications, are aware of the assumptions you are making, and state them explicitly. 
        </p>

        <h2>Solution Correctness</h2>

        <p>
            There may be many ways to go about solving a programming problem, but when all related concerns are taken into consideration, typically there is only one truly correct solution that optimally satisfies all of them.
        </p>

        
        <p> 
            The correct solution uses the appropriate data structures, types, algorithms, and coding style, that match the inherent complexity of the problem while minimizing incidental complexity of the implementation. 
        </p>

        <h2>Clarity </h2>
        
        <p>
            At Chaldal, we strive to write code with a strong focus on readability and ease of understanding. This applies to formatting, naming of files, order of code in a file, directory structure, and control flow. We specifically look for the following pieces:
        </p>

        <h3> Naming </h3>

        <p>
        Choosing an appropriate name for a thing forces one to carefully consider what the thing really is, and doing so has a side effect of crystallizing and streamlining one’s thinking. Name all the things to maximize readability for expected readers, with awareness for its and the surrounding/calling code’s context. </p>

        <h3> Neatness </h3> 
        <p> Just like syntax highlighting brings out hidden structure in code and makes your brain unconsciously aware of it, so does neat and consistent formatting. All white space and other formatting should be clean and consistent, either with a style guide, or at least internally consistent. </p>
        
        <h3> Architecture </h3> 
        <p> We believe that a clean and simple architecture with clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a> is key to avoiding several classes of bugs and makes a system easy to understand and modify. </p>

         <h3> Presentation </h3> 
        <p>  
            How easy is it for an evaluator to review your code? Your solution must be packaged and presented with the objective of reducing friction and unnecessary overhead for those reviewing it. Well placed READMEs, adherence to submission guidelines are some ways to achieve this.
        </p>

        <h2>Functional Design & Immutability</h2>
        <p>
            Functional and Immutable programming paradigms allow one to avoid large classes of bugs, and we believe that they should be considered the de facto standard for building software. We look for engineers that understand the benefits they offer and use these techniques eloquently. When by circumstance they are forced to write in a non-functional, mutable language, they write their code as close to a functional/immutable way as possible without severe loss of readability/performance.
        </p>

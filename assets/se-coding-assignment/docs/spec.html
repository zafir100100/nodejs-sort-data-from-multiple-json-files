        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for your interest in joining our team. We need to evaluate
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>how well candidates can think about problems they are presented with</li>
            <li>how proficient the candidates are at building large-scale software systems</li>
            <li>how attentive the candidates are to detail</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Completing this take-home question will give us the data points we need to make this
            evaluation. Thank you for the time you put into building the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
            We strongly encourage you to read in full and understand the Chaldal Engineering Standards
            document <code>engineering-standards.html</code>, and adjust your problem solving and
            coding approach to match the criteria we'll be evaluating you on.
        </p>

        <h1>Task</h1>
        <p>
            Build a program to analyze app usage data for a hypothetical menu planning calendar app.
            On any day, a user can plan multiple meals, and each meal may have multiple dishes. The
            program you build will analyze how engaged users are with the app.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the <code>./data</code> folder, you will find a bunch of files in the form <code>userId.json</code>.
            They contain app data for a bunch of users. The structure should be fairly obvious upon examination.
        </p>

        <p>Within a specific date range, users can be filtered into three types</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Active:</code> users who had at least 5 meals in the specified period </li>
            <li><code>Superactive:</code> users who had more than 10 meals in the specified period</li>
            <li><code>Bored:</code> Users who were “active” in the preceding period, but not “active” in the specified period.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Example Input & Output </h3>

        <p>
            <code class="block">
            ./dist/run active 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
           should list “active” users during the specified period as a list of comma-separated user ids.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            ./dist/run superactive 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
            should list the “super-active” users during the specified
            period as a list of comma-separated user ids.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            ./dist/run bored 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
            should list the “bored” users during the specified period as a list of comma-separated user ids
        </p>



        <h1>Guidelines</h1>

        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>
            There are many ways to write such a program. When choosing your style, imagine that you are
            building a system that will evolve to handling many more features in the very near future,
            so structure your code in a way that would support such a future.
        </p>

        <h2>Language</h2>
        <p>
            Use a language of your choice. Include instructions to get your submission file to a runnable state,
            including details of what OS/version your code is meant to be run on.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary">
            NOTE: For the purpose of this assignment, avoid choosing languages that you are new to or are experimenting with. This is because we want to see the candidate's coding
            skills (naming, layout, design, readability, use of libraries, idioms, best practices) at their
            absolute best, and using a new and unfamiliar language is unlikely to produce optimal results given the constraint of time.
        </p>

      
        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
            Please explicitly state any assumptions you make in a README.md file at the root of your submission. If any part of the spec seems unclear, you can make your best assumption and include them in the same file. Please do not send instructions in your response e-mail. Information sent in the email body will not be reviewed by evaluators. 
        </p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            Please submit the code, data, build instructions, and whatever else
            you deem necessary to help us reach our stated evaluation goals in a single compressed archive. Do not include any built binaries or executables within your submission, as it may get filtered by anti-virus software.
        </p>

        <h2>Expected Amount of Work</h2>
        <p>
            We expect this work to be completed in about 3 to 4 hours. If it starts looking like it will take
            longer than that, possibly your coding speed is slower than we were hoping for. Speed is only one
            facet of building software, and we’d love to evaluate as many facets as we can in this exercise,
            but do not want to cost you any more time beyond what we expect and consider reasonable.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, if 2 hours into it you think you’ll run way overtime, please cut scope, in a way that maximizes
            your chance of demonstrating the things listed in the “purpose” section of this document. Having
            some runnable code is better than having a bunch of code that doesn’t run.
